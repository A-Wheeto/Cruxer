    <p class="fs-4">What is Climbing and Bouldering?</p>
    <p>Climbing involves ascending rock faces or artificial walls using hands, feet, and sometimes special equipment like ropes and harnesses. It can be done indoors at climbing gyms or outdoors on natural rock formations. Climbing has various disciplines, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Top-rope climbing:</strong> Climbing with a rope anchored at the top of the climb.</li>
      <li><strong>Lead climbing:</strong> Climbing while placing protection (gear) along the route as you ascend.</li>
      <li><strong>Trad climbing:</strong> Using removable gear to protect against falls.</li>
      <li><strong>Sport climbing:</strong> Climbing with pre-placed anchors on the rock.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Bouldering</strong>, on the other hand, is a form of climbing performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. Climbs, known as "problems," are typically shorter and require intense bursts of strength and technique. Safety is maintained with the use of crash pads and spotters.</p>
